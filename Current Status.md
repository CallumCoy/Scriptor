# Scriptor
This is the code and documentation of the program Scriptor. Scriptor is an app that allows priests to plan the songs that will be sung during the service. Made by JAWC (group 3) as a class project COP4331, Processes for Object Orientated Development.


## Current Status
- I have made the code file
- The base user stories have been written
- The Product back Log is layed out, currently lacks priority, difficulty, and validation criteria.
- Sprint backlog is just a duplicate of the product backlog right now. 
- Vision statement has been created, but it is only has the key points it does not have the paper written yet
- Product Backlog is yet to be made.
- Requirements yet to be made.
- Design Documents such as the UML are also not made.
