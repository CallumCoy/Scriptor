1,Psalm 103,"Bless the Lord, O my soul! You are very great, O Lord my God!

Clothed in pomp and brilliance, arrayed with light as with a cloak.

Stretching out the sky as a tent-cloth, covering your lofty walls with water.

You make the clouds your conveyance, You surge upon the wings of the wind.

You make spirits your messengers and flaming fires your attendants.

You settle the earth on its firm foundation: it shall stand unmoved from age to age.

The abyss covers it like a garment; waters stand over the mountains.

At your rebuke, they will take to flight, at the peal of your thunder they will fear.

They hurdle the hills and run down the dales to the place you have chosen for them.

You have set up a boundary not to be passed: they shall never return to cover the earth.

Down in the gullies You make springs to rise: waters shall go down between the mountains.

They shall give drink to the beasts of the field: wild asses will seek them to quench their thirst.

The birds of the sky will abide by them: from among the rocks they will raise their song.

From your lofty halls You refresh the mountains; the earth shall be fed with the fruit of your works.

You make green pastures for the cattle and food-plants for the service of man,

So that bread may be brought forth from the earth and wine that gladdens the heart of man.

So that oil may put a gleam upon his face and that bread may strengthen the heart of man.

The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted.

The sparrows will build their nests in them and the herons will call them their home.

To the deer belong high mountains, to rodents the shelter of the rocks.

You have made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows the time of its setting.

You establish darkness and it is night wherein the forest creatures prowl around.

Young lions roar for their prey and call out to God for their meat.

As the sun rises they will come together and lay themselves down in their dens.

Man will go out to his labor and work until eventide.

How great are your works, O Lord! In wisdom You have wrought them all: the earth is filled with your creatures.

Even the wide and open sea itself: within it there are countless creeping things, living beings small and large.

Upon it there are ships a-sailing and that great beast You made to have fun.

All of them look up to You to give them their food in due time.

You provide and they gather up; you open your hand and they are full.

You hide your face and they cringe, you suspend their breath and they die and return to their dust.

You send forth your breath and they live: You renew the face of the earth!

May the Lord's glory endure forever, may the Lord rejoice in his works.

He looks upon the earth and makes it quake, He touches the mountains and they smoke.

I will sing to the Lord as long as I live, I will praise my God as long as I last.

Would that my thoughts be pleasing to Him and I will rejoice in the Lord.

May the sinners vanish from the earth and may the wicked be no more.

Bless the Lord, O my soul!

The sun knows the time of its setting: You establish darkness and it is night.

How great are your works, O Lord! In wisdom You have wrought them all.

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and always and forever and ever. Amen.

Allilouia, Allilouia, Allilouia, glory to You, O God! "
2,Silent Night,"Silent night, holy night! All is calm, all is bright, 'round yon virgin mother and child, holy Infant so tender and mild. Sleep in heavenly peace! Sleep in heavenly peace.
Silent night, holy night! Shepherds quake at the sight. Glories stream from heaven afar; heav'nly hosts sing Alleluia. Christ the Savior is born! Christ the Savior is born.
Silent night, holy night! Son of God, love's pure light, Radiant beams from thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace! Jesus, Lord, at thy birth! Jesus, Lord, at thy birth."
3,Angels From Heaven,"Angels from heaven came to you shepherds. Have no fear! Have no fear! Haten to honor Him, born near in Bethlehem; Offer gifts though poor and small.
There in a manger, you will behold Him, Son of God. Song of God. Child whose humility veils His divinity, Our true Savior, Christ the Lord.
So close beside Him, Mary His mother; Virgin pure! Virgin pure! Soothed by her gentle hands, while beasts in wonder stand, Her true Son, yet Son of God."
4,At the most Holy Cross,"At the most holy cross of our Savior, we bow in honor and sing our praise; we praise your suff'ring and all your torments, for it was by them you saved us all.
At the most holy cross of our Savior, now and forever we bow our head. In your great mercy you poured our your life, saving all sinners with such great love."
5,Beneath Your Compassion,"Beneath your compassion we take refuge, O Virgin Theotokos. Despise not our pray'rs, pray'rs in our need, but deliver us from dangers, for you alone are pure, for you alone are pure, for you alone are pure and blessed."
6,Beneath your Cross I Stand,"Beneath your Cross I stand; O Savior, hear my request. Turn me from all sin; let me feel remorse. Here, let me pray and rest.
For me you suffered shame; for me you suffered your cross. You paid for my sins; you paid for my faults. You redeemed mankind lost.
From you I'll never turn; for me your last breath you spent. Let your seven words, spoken from your cross be my strength to repent. "
7,Christ our King who reigns with justice,"Christ our King, who reigns with justice, Lord of all, now and forever more! Yet you suffered; for they jeered You and mocked You; For your Throne they gave You the Cross.
In the Garden when You prayed for help, You knew they would come to seize You soon, then came Judas whom You loved like all the Others, and he gave You the kiss of doom.
While You prayed there in the Garden, bloody sweat You poured out for our sake. Though the angels tried to comfort You with the cup, just the cup of death you soon would know."
8,Come now all you faithful,"Come now all you faithful, look up on the Cross; For our Savior died there to save all the lost. Mary stands there weeping, heart so pierced with sorrow, shedding tears so bitter mourning her Son.
On that holy evening, Jesus prayed for us, Knowing that the morrow would bring Him the Cross. Judas would betray him for the coins of silver, and be lost forever, lost forever.
All that He would suffer was to ransom us; For the price of our fall was to be the cross. Now we must remember: Only Christ could save us; No one else could suffer all that he would."
