1	Psalm 103	"Bless the Lord, O my soul! You are very great, O Lord my God!

Clothed in pomp and brilliance, arrayed with light as with a cloak.

Stretching out the sky as a tent-cloth, covering your lofty walls with water.

You make the clouds your conveyance, You surge upon the wings of the wind.

You make spirits your messengers and flaming fires your attendants.

You settle the earth on its firm foundation: it shall stand unmoved from age to age.

The abyss covers it like a garment; waters stand over the mountains.

At your rebuke, they will take to flight, at the peal of your thunder they will fear.

They hurdle the hills and run down the dales to the place you have chosen for them.

You have set up a boundary not to be passed: they shall never return to cover the earth.

Down in the gullies You make springs to rise: waters shall go down between the mountains.

They shall give drink to the beasts of the field: wild asses will seek them to quench their thirst.

The birds of the sky will abide by them: from among the rocks they will raise their song.

From your lofty halls You refresh the mountains; the earth shall be fed with the fruit of your works.

You make green pastures for the cattle and food-plants for the service of man,

So that bread may be brought forth from the earth and wine that gladdens the heart of man.

So that oil may put a gleam upon his face and that bread may strengthen the heart of man.

The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted.

The sparrows will build their nests in them and the herons will call them their home.

To the deer belong high mountains, to rodents the shelter of the rocks.

You have made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows the time of its setting.

You establish darkness and it is night wherein the forest creatures prowl around.

Young lions roar for their prey and call out to God for their meat.

As the sun rises they will come together and lay themselves down in their dens.

Man will go out to his labor and work until eventide.

How great are your works, O Lord! In wisdom You have wrought them all: the earth is filled with your creatures.

Even the wide and open sea itself: within it there are countless creeping things, living beings small and large.

Upon it there are ships a-sailing and that great beast You made to have fun.

All of them look up to You to give them their food in due time.

You provide and they gather up; you open your hand and they are full.

You hide your face and they cringe, you suspend their breath and they die and return to their dust.

You send forth your breath and they live: You renew the face of the earth!

May the Lord's glory endure forever, may the Lord rejoice in his works.

He looks upon the earth and makes it quake, He touches the mountains and they smoke.

I will sing to the Lord as long as I live, I will praise my God as long as I last.

Would that my thoughts be pleasing to Him and I will rejoice in the Lord.

May the sinners vanish from the earth and may the wicked be no more.

Bless the Lord, O my soul!

The sun knows the time of its setting: You establish darkness and it is night.

How great are your works, O Lord! In wisdom You have wrought them all.

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and always and forever and ever. Amen.

Allilouia, Allilouia, Allilouia, glory to You, O God! "
2	Silent Night	"Silent night, holy night! All is calm, all is bright, 'round yon virgin mother and child, holy Infant so tender and mild. Sleep in heavenly peace! Sleep in heavenly peace.
Silent night, holy night! Shepherds quake at the sight. Glories stream from heaven afar; heav'nly hosts sing Alleluia. Christ the Savior is born! Christ the Savior is born.
Silent night, holy night! Son of God, love's pure light, Radiant beams from thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace! Jesus, Lord, at thy birth! Jesus, Lord, at thy birth."
3	Angels From Heaven	"Angels from heaven came to you shepherds. Have no fear! Have no fear! Haten to honor Him, born near in Bethlehem; Offer gifts though poor and small.
There in a manger, you will behold Him, Son of God. Song of God. Child whose humility veils His divinity, Our true Savior, Christ the Lord.
So close beside Him, Mary His mother; Virgin pure! Virgin pure! Soothed by her gentle hands, while beasts in wonder stand, Her true Son, yet Son of God."
4	At the most Holy Cross	"At the most holy cross of our Savior, we bow in honor and sing our praise; we praise your suff'ring and all your torments, for it was by them you saved us all.
At the most holy cross of our Savior, now and forever we bow our head. In your great mercy you poured our your life, saving all sinners with such great love."
5	Beneath Your Compassion	"Beneath your compassion we take refuge, O Virgin Theotokos. Despise not our pray'rs, pray'rs in our need, but deliver us from dangers, for you alone are pure, for you alone are pure, for you alone are pure and blessed."
6	Beneath your Cross I Stand	"Beneath your Cross I stand; O Savior, hear my request. Turn me from all sin; let me feel remorse. Here, let me pray and rest.
For me you suffered shame; for me you suffered your cross. You paid for my sins; you paid for my faults. You redeemed mankind lost.
From you I'll never turn; for me your last breath you spent. Let your seven words, spoken from your cross be my strength to repent. "
7	Christ our King who reigns with justice	"Christ our King, who reigns with justice, Lord of all, now and forever more! Yet you suffered; for they jeered You and mocked You; For your Throne they gave You the Cross.
In the Garden when You prayed for help, You knew they would come to seize You soon, then came Judas whom You loved like all the Others, and he gave You the kiss of doom.
While You prayed there in the Garden, bloody sweat You poured out for our sake. Though the angels tried to comfort You with the cup, just the cup of death you soon would know."
8	Come now all you faithful	"Come now all you faithful, look up on the Cross; For our Savior died there to save all the lost. Mary stands there weeping, heart so pierced with sorrow, shedding tears so bitter mourning her Son.
On that holy evening, Jesus prayed for us, Knowing that the morrow would bring Him the Cross. Judas would betray him for the coins of silver, and be lost forever, lost forever.
All that He would suffer was to ransom us; For the price of our fall was to be the cross. Now we must remember: Only Christ could save us; No one else could suffer all that he would."
9	Do not forsake us	"Do not forsake us, do not forsake us, O Lord,
O Lord, do not forsake us.
You did promise at the supper you would never leave us orphans; for within you heart you know we have need of you in our life.
Let your kindly light be in us, shining like the sun above us; let your light of love shine down from the Cross forever more."
10	Psalm 23	"The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Fresh and green are the pastures where he gives me repose. 
Near restful waters he leads me, to revive my drooping spirit.
He guides me along the right path; he is true to his name.
If I should walk in the valley of darkness no evil would I fear.
You are there with your crook and your staff; 
with these you give me comfort. You have prepared a banquet
for me in the sight of my foes. My head you have anointed 
with oil; my cup is overflowing.R.Surely goodness and 
kindness shall follow me all the days of my life.
In the Lord’s own house shall I dwell for ever and ever."
11	Psalm 24	"The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it,
    the world, and all who live in it;
for he founded it on the seas
    and established it on the waters.
Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord?
    Who may stand in his holy place?
The one who has clean hands and a pure heart,
    who does not trust in an idol
    or swear by a false god.[a]
They will receive blessing from the Lord
    and vindication from God their Savior.
Such is the generation of those who seek him,
    who seek your face, God of Jacob.[b][c]
Lift up your heads, you gates;
    be lifted up, you ancient doors,
    that the King of glory may come in.
Who is this King of glory?
    The Lord strong and mighty,
    the Lord mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads, you gates;
    lift them up, you ancient doors,
    that the King of glory may come in.
Who is he, this King of glory?
    The Lord Almighty—
    he is the King of glory."
12	Psalm 116	"I love the Lord, for he heard my voice;
    he heard my cry for mercy.
Because he turned his ear to me,
    I will call on him as long as I live.
The cords of death entangled me,
    the anguish of the grave came over me;
    I was overcome by distress and sorrow.
Then I called on the name of the Lord:
    “Lord, save me!”
The Lord is gracious and righteous;
    our God is full of compassion.
The Lord protects the unwary;
    when I was brought low, he saved me.
Return to your rest, my soul,
    for the Lord has been good to you.
For you, Lord, have delivered me from death,
    my eyes from tears,
    my feet from stumbling,
that I may walk before the Lord
    in the land of the living.
I trusted in the Lord when I said,
    “I am greatly afflicted”;
in my alarm I said,
    “Everyone is a liar.”
What shall I return to the Lord
    for all his goodness to me?
I will lift up the cup of salvation
    and call on the name of the Lord.
I will fulfill my vows to the Lord
    in the presence of all his people.
Precious in the sight of the Lord
    is the death of his faithful servants.
Truly I am your servant, Lord;
    I serve you just as my mother did;
    you have freed me from my chains.
I will sacrifice a thank offering to you
    and call on the name of the Lord.
I will fulfill my vows to the Lord
    in the presence of all his people,
in the courts of the house of the Lord—
    in your midst, Jerusalem.

Praise the Lord."

15	Resurrection Matins	"While the priest removes the Burial Shroud from the sepulchre 
to the altar, the people sing the following Troparion:

When You descended to death, O Immortal Life, You destroyed 
the Abyss by the radiance of Your divinity. And when You raised 
the dead from the depths of the earth all the heavenly powers 
cried out: * ""O Giver of Life, Christ our God, glory be to You.""

The priest and faithful make a solemn procession once around the church.

During the procession the following Troparion is sung repeatedly:

Your resurrection, O Christ, our Savior,
the Angels in heaven praise with hymns;
make us, on earth, also worthy with a
pure heart to extol and give glory to You.

The procession stops before the closed doors of the church and the priest begins:

TROPARION WITH VERSES

Priest: Glory to the holy, consubstantial, life-creating and indivisible Trinity, always, now and ever, and forever.

People: Amen.

Then the priest sings in Tone 5:

Priest: Christ is risen from the dead! By death He conquered Death, and to those in the graves He granted life.

The people repeat the Troparion twice:

Christ is risen from the dead! By death He conquered Death, and to those in the graves He granted life. (2 times)

Priest: Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered, * and let those who hate Him flee from before His face.

People: Christ is risen from the dead! By death He conquered Death, and to those in the graves He granted life.

Priest: As smoke vanishes, so let them vanish * as wax melts before a fire.

The doors are opened and the celebrant, preceded by candle-bearers and servers, enters the church followed by the faithful who sing:

People: And to those in the graves He granted life."
16	"The Resurrection of Our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus Christ"	"Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered,
and let those who hate Him flee from before His face.
As smoke vanishes, so let them vanish as wax melts before a fire.
 So let the wicked perish at the presence of God and let the righteous ones rejoice.
 This is the day that the Lord has made; let us exalt and rejoice in it.
 

Priest: Wisdom!

People: Give the blessing!

and forever.

Priest: O most holy Mother of God, save us.

People: Amen.

The priest raises the handcross to the people three times, each time saying:

Priest: Christ is risen!

And the people respond each time:

People: Indeed He is risen!

Then the following is sung three times:

Christ is risen from the dead! By death He conquered Death, and to those in the graves He granted life.

And after the third time the following is added:

And to us He granted life eternal. * Let us glorify His resurrection. "
17	Sunday of the Myrrh-bearers	"When You did descend unto death, O Life Immortal, then did You slay Hades with the lightening of Your Divinity. And when You did also raise the dead out of the nethermost depths, all the power in the Heavens cried out: O Life-giver, Christ our God, glory be to You. Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. The noble Joseph, taking Your immaculate body down from the Tree, and having wrapped it in pure linen and spices, laid it for burial in a new tomb. But on the third day You did arise, O Lord, granting great mercy to the world. Now and forever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. Unto the myrrh-bearing women did the Angel cry out as he stood by the grave: Myrrh-oils are meet for the dead, but Christ has proved to be a stranger to corruption. But cry out: The Lord is risen, granting great mercy to the world."
18	Sunday of Thomas	"While the tomb was sealed, You, O Life, did shine forth from the grave, O Christ God; and while the doors were shut, You did come unto Your disciples, O Resurrection of all, renewing through them an upright Spirit in us according to Your great mercy. With his searching right hand, Thomas did probe Your life-bestowing side, O Christ God; for when You did enter while the doors were shut, he cried out unto You with the rest of the Apostles: You are my Lord and my God."
19	Earth and Heaven Mourn	"Earth and heaven mourn their Maker as he suffers crucifixion. Amid thunder and the lightning they rain tears for their Creator as he hangs there.
O most holy Virgin Mother, by cross you suffer sorrow. It is our sins that he dies for, causing tears and lamentations for your dying Son."
20	Eternal God	"Eternal God, Through gates of birth, from heaven's throne came down to earth. Shepherds adore, angels sing; Star shines on the newborn King. Jesus Christ is born.
Bethelehem's child, born in a cave; Messiah sent here to save. Destined to make sacrifice; Only God could pay such price for the fall of man."
21	God the Lord Eternal	"God the Lord eternal shows Himself to us. Born in humble manger from a virgin spotless. Choirs of angels joyfully sing welcome to this new born King. Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory to God in the highest!
Shepherds in their pastures hear the joyful story, Kings and poor together at the crib of glory. So they may honor this newborn King, raising voices, gloriously sing: Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory to God in the highest!"
22	God's Son is Born	"God's Son is born, but a mystery to our mind. Jesus, his name, means the Saviour of mankind. 
Mary, his Mother, lulls him with her singing, Choirs of the angels tuneful praise are bringing.
Joseph, her husband, rocks the cradle slowly; ""Sleep little Baby, in your bed so lowly.""

Now the angels sing their prayer, making known this Child so fair. Shepherds hear the angels' song, come and keep watch all night long. Sheep and oxen gaze and warm this newborn Babe, for all creation knows this is their Lord."
23	"Have mercy on me, O my God"	"Have mercy on me, O my God, in your great goodness, for it is your kindness and great mercy that forgives.
In the greatness of your mercy, blot out my offense. Wash away my sins completely, cleanse me of my sin."
24	Having suffered	"Having suffered the passion for us, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on us."
25	Heaven and Earth	"Heaven and earth, heaven and earth now welcome their Redeemer. Angels and people, angels and people join in a celebration. 
In Bethlehem, in Bethlehem God's Word is given birth. Born of a virgin, born of a Virgin, Master of heaven and earth.
Salvation is begun, born is the Virgin's Son; Angel voices ringing, Wise men gifts are bringing; Shepherds tell the story; star proclaims the glory; Christ is born in Bethlehem."
26	In Gethsemane's Darkness	"In Gethsemane's darkness Jesus prayed for us; When he asked God for the strength to bear the Cross.
Angels came to serve our Lord the help He sought; Strength to suffer, from the chalice which they brought.
On the morrow you must bear the Cross in pain; Slowly from your bloody wounds all life will wane.
The sword of sorrow, foretold long ago, Your Mother's heart will know."
27	In The Town of Bethlehem	"In the town of Bethlehem, Mary's Son is born a King. Born to bless us and to save us and to lead all men to God, O Savior.
In a cave at Bethlehem, bed of straw His royal throne, Mary wondered, Joseph pondered how the Child was Son of God, the Savior."
28	The Star Spangled Banner	"O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country, should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation.
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: 'In God is our trust.'
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!"
29	The Star Spangled Banner	"O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,

Liberty for captives, good news for the outcast, Comfort for the mourner, redemption at the last!"

That day the streets were filled with people; with palms and brances in their hands. They waved them high and cried Hosanna, O Son of David, King of Israel, O Son of David, King of Israel.
Christ entered in this holy city, another prophecy to fulfil We know that now their cries Hosanna, would change to Crucify, away with Him, would change to Crucify, away with Him.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages; Light of Light: true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from the heavens, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man; And was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried; And arose again on the third day according to the Scriptures; And ascended into the heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; And shall come again, with glory, to judge both the living and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life; Who proceedeth from the Father; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spake by the prophets. In One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead, And the life of the age to come. Amen."

Saint John the Baptist, Saint John the Baptist, foretells release today; The Lamb of God, The Lamb of God will wash our sins away.

and lead us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil."
