# Vision Statement

Our program is for members of the community that attend religious gatherings.  It is built specifically to help the newer members of the religious communities that struggle to keep up with the readings.

Our program is called scriptor, which is the literal translation of “script” in Latin.  Our categories would land under religious since our since our app is a database of religious songs that are sung at church services.  Productivity, since it helps to make a task quicker and more efficient.  Reference, since our app will allow the user to look up different religious songs.

This app will make two processes easier to accomplish.  The first task is it will allow members to instantly role into the next song of the service swiftly.  This will allow the service to run along smoother, and also lower interruptions of new members having to ask their neighbor for help.  The second task is it will illuminate the need to remember to get cash from the bank if you decide to donate to the bank, by allowing you to donate electronically.

As of right now, there are no current modern alternatives for reading the songs other than the good old-fashioned way of scrolling through the book.  Except for getting the script on Amazon books which would be a pain to navigate, if you did not know any keywords to look up.

Scriptor beats both methods because it will be made around making the task of navigating through the songs of the day effortlessly.  This will be achieved since the priest will set up the order of the songs before the service.  The churchgoers will then be able to download the order of the songs for the next service.  Meaning members of the church will not need to search for the for the next song since the program will know what to show next.

# Sprint 1

For sprint one we aim to finish off a base plan.  We also hope to get the basic program done for android, IOS, web portal, and the database.  Although we do not plan on having them work in cohesion yet.
