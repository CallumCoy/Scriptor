We will have 3 different databases.  One will hold songs for specific churches, this database will be connected to the church database, which has the information for each church.  The third database will contain songs that are used throughout most churches and connect be edited by a priest. We will also have a portal that connects the priest, and Global list of songs to the database that holds the church's information.
